This document contains instructions for installation and use for the "Latch Wifi Plugin".

Modifying the source code hostapd, you can make networks "WPA-PSK" and "WPA2-PSK" will support latch.

First of all remember to write you ApplicationID and Secret in :
    *latchWifi.c and latchWifiUtility.c in the repository root.
    *latchWifi.c in /Patch/src/utils
The files are the same in diferents folders, it's just an ease to install.

Also in "latchWifi.c" you can change "FILE_CONFIG" to change the location of saved of accountID and "OPTION_ERROR" change the behavior in case of error 
(Unable to connect to latch or API responds with error)

Note that when using privileges latchWifiUtility need read / write in the "FILE_CONFIG" defined.

Installation and use step by step:

1. Download hostapd 2.3.4 sources . Execute: git clone git://w1.fi/srv/git/hostap.git

   This will create a folder called "hostap" which will be the hostapd source code, the program responsible for creating the Wi-Fi network.

2. Download hostapd.conf (From Github "Latch Wifi Plugin" repository).
   
   hostapd.conf is the hostapd configuration file, it contains among other things the SSID, network password, encryption type, etc.
   More info in this example: http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/hostapd/hostapd.conf

3. Download the Folder "Patch" (From Github "Latch Wifi Plugin" repository).

   This contains two folders:
        * "hostapd", which contains the main.c file, it was modified to initialize the configuration Latch and seek accountID.
        * "src", divided into : 
                    ->"ap" containing wpa_auth.c, it was modified to check the status of Latch,
                     this is done by modifying the "PTKSTART" status before sending the first message of "4-way Handshake".

                    ->"utils"  This contains latch.c, latch.h are Latch SDK and 
                    latchWifi.c, latchWifi.h containing functions used to initialize, pairing, check status and des-pairing latch.
                                
4. Execute "sudo apt-get install libnl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev" for install dependency of hostapd.

    "Openssl and libcurl" are necessary for the latch sdk, while "libnl-dev" is required to compile hostapd.

5. Download the utility for install,uninstall and check the status of latch (latchWifiUtility.c) and compile
   with "gcc -o latchWifiUtility latchWifiUtility.c latchWifi.c latch.c -lcurl -lcrypto -lssl -ldl"

   Obviously, "latchWifiUtility.c latchWifi.c latch.c" must be in the same folder, otherwise you have to modify the command to indicate where they are located.

6. Change to directory ./hostap/hostapd.
7. cp defconfig .config
   
   This is necessary to successfully compile hostapd 

8. Apply the plugin, copy the "Patch" folder to ./hostap and replaces all.

   In this step, modifying the source code to add support to latch.

9. Execute 
  "gcc -c -o ../src/utils/latch.o ../src/utils/latch.c   && gcc -c -o ../src/utils/latchWifi.o ../src/utils/latchWifi.c"

   You need to compile a "Objects file" the libraries for compilation then be linked.

10. Append in Makefile:

OBJS += ../src/utils/latchWifi.o
OBJS += ../src/utils/latch.o
LIBS += -lcurl -lcrypto -lssl -ldl


This will cause a compile time, the make command link and find the libraries and "Objects files"

11. Execute "make"

    Compile time!, Cross your fingers!

12. Execute "sudo mkdir /etc/hostapd/ && sudo cp ../../hostapd.conf /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
    
    The "/ etc / hostapd" folder is created and hostapd.conf configuration file is placed there.
    It can be placed anywhere else but in step 14 would have to modify the command with the correct path.    
    
13. Execute "sudo latchWifiUtility -i [PAIR_CODE_LATCH_HERE]"
    
    * With the option "-i" latch is paired and saves the accountID in "/etc/latchWifi.conf",
    this route can be modified by changing the "latchWifi.c" file "FILE_CONFIG" define , which is in the folder "/Patch/src/utils"

    * With the option "-s" latch status is queried and the user can see it.
    
    * With the option "-u", the file indicated by "FILE_CONFIG" is deleted, which by default is "/etc/latchWifi.conf"
    
    * With the "-h" option, support shown

14. Execute "sudo ./hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf", Start the Wifi Network.

    Hostapd need root privileges to control the interfaces, if the hostapd.conf file is in another location, adjust the command.

15. Wireless network with ssid "Testing" and Password 12345678 , This ready for client connections.

    The ssid and password can be changed at hostapd.conf, read the link posted above.
    Each time a client attempts to connect, is verified that the password is correct and the state of latch,
    if the password is correct and latch is unlocked the client will connect.
    If the password is incorrect or the state of latch is locked client could not connect.

16. Execute "sudo latchWifiUtility -u" for uninstall latch Plugin.

    This eliminates the latch paring, and delete the referenced "FILE_CONFIG" file, which is "/etc/latchWifi.conf" by default.
